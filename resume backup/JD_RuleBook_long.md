## LLM INSTRUCTIONS

**Purpose:** Create an unbiased, comprehensive rulebook for optimal resume content based solely on JD requirements. This will guide a second AI in generating the best possible resume.

**Focus:**
- **Content only** - what to say, not formatting
- **Hyper-specific** to actual JD - real examples, not generic
- **Actionable templates** with [variables]
- **Concrete numbers** for targets (must be specific, not ranges)
- **Real JD terminology** in examples
- **Evidence-based ranking** using JD frequency
- **Adaptive to experience level** - recognize new grad vs experienced profiles
- **Clear, explicit instructions** - avoid ambiguity; the rewrite AI needs precise guidance
- Use consistent terminology throughout (if you call something "Tier 1 keyword" in Section 2, use that exact term in all later sections)
- Be explicit about priorities (use "MUST", "SHOULD", "COULD" language)
- Provide complete examples, not partial ones
- Include the "why" for each major recommendation so the rewrite AI understands intent

**Content Generation Approach:**
- Create ideal bullet points and content examples that perfectly demonstrate JD requirements
- Use realistic, industry-standard metrics appropriate for the role level
- Generate compelling achievements that showcase all Top 5 Priorities
- Suggest achievable projects/experiences that fill capability gaps
- Mark additions as **[CORE]**, **[SUPPLEMENTARY]**, or **[SUGGESTED - Add if applicable]**
- Prioritize maximum ATS match and recruiter impact
- Be creative in generating realistic scenarios that align with JD needs
