---

## 5. NEW GRAD ACHIEVEMENT FORMULAS

**Primary:** `[Action Verb] + [Tech] + [What You Built] + [Realistic Metric]`

**Appropriate New Grad Metrics:**
1. **Performance/Quality:** "Improved load time by 2s", "Achieved 85% accuracy", "Reduced errors by 30%"
2. **Scale:** "Processed 1000+ records", "Handled 500 requests/day", "Used by 100+ testers"
3. **Contribution:** "Fixed 15 bugs", "Implemented 3 features", "Wrote 500+ lines of code"
4. **Team/Learning:** "Collaborated with 3 developers", "Completed 5 sprints", "Learned [tech] to build [X]"

**Good Verbs for New Grads:**
- Built, Developed, Implemented, Created, Designed
- Contributed, Assisted, Collaborated, Debugged, Tested
- Deployed, Configured, Integrated, Optimized

**Avoid (unless true):**
- Managed, Directed, Architected, Spearheaded

**Formula Examples:**
- `Built [feature/app] using [tech stack] to [solve problem], achieving [metric]`
- `Implemented [functionality] in [system/project] using [tech], resulting in [improvement]`
- `Developed [component] with [tech] that [benefit/outcome]`

**Bad Bullet Examples to Avoid:**
- ❌ "Responsible for developing features" (passive, no tech/outcome)
- ❌ "Worked on a team to build an app" (vague, no contribution)
- ❌ "Helped with backend development" (no specifics)
- ✅ "Built REST API using Flask and PostgreSQL to automate data retrieval, reducing manual queries by 40%"

---

## 6. JD-SPECIFIC RULES

**Content Requirements (4 rules):**

1. **[Rule Title]** - [One-line requirement]
   - Evidence: [JD citation]
   - Example: "[Brief example]"

2. **[Continue for 4 rules]**

**Red Flags:**
- ❌ [Flag] - Why: [JD-based reason]

---

## 7. NEW GRAD CONTENT GUIDANCE

**Summary (2-3 lines):**
Template: "Recent [Degree] graduate with hands-on experience in [Tier 1 tech] through [internships/projects]. Skilled in [2-3 areas]. Seeking to apply [skill] in [role type]."
- Include: 3-4 Tier 1 keywords naturally
- Keep grounded and eager
- Avoid: "Extensive", "Expert", "Seasoned"

**Skills:**
- Mirror Section 2 categories, Tier 1 first
- List honestly (proficiency will be tested)

**Education (LEAD WITH THIS):**
- Degree, Major, University
- GPA if 3.5+, Graduation date
- **Relevant Coursework:** 6 courses matching JD keywords
- Honors, certifications, academic achievements

**Experience (Internships/Co-ops/Research/Part-time):**
- Structure: [Action] + [Tech] + [What] + [Outcome]
- Bullets: Most recent (3-4) | Previous (2-3)
- Focus: What you built/learned + realistic impact
- Demonstrate all 4 priorities through available experience
- Use appropriate scale (see Section 5)

**Projects (CRITICAL - 2-3 strong projects):**
- Must match JD tech stack + demonstrate Priorities #1-2
- Structure: "Built [X] using [tech stack] to [solve problem], achieving [metric]"
- Include: Problem + technologies + outcome
- Types: Personal projects, hackathons, capstone, open source
- Show technical depth and problem-solving
- **Strong Project Criteria:**
  - Solves a real problem (not trivial apps like calculators)
  - Uses 3+ JD technologies
  - Has measurable outcome (users, performance, functionality)
  - Include GitHub link if code is clean and well-documented

**Certifications (if relevant):**
[AWS, Google, Microsoft certs boost entry-level profiles]

**Optional Sections:**

## 8. IDEAL NEW GRAD EXAMPLES

**Generate 3-4 experience bullets and 3-4 project bullets (for reference only) using:**
- JD keywords from Section 2
- New grad formulas from Section 5
- Priorities from Section 4
- Realistic metrics appropriate for 0-1 year experience

**Distribution:**
- Priority #1: 2 example bullets
- Priority #2: 2 example bullets
- Priority #3: 1 example bullet
- Priority #4: 1 example bullet

**Scale Reference for Entry-Level:**

Appropriate metrics:
- Users: 50-500 (not millions)
- Performance: 20-40% improvements (not 10x)
- Team size: 2-5 people (not 10+)
- Data: 1K-10K records (not terabytes)
- Time saved: Hours per week (not $100K annually)

Appropriate scope:
- Features/components (not entire systems)
- Course/personal projects (not enterprise platforms)
- Learning + contribution (not leading teams)

**Format for each example:**
[Action Verb] + [JD Tech] + [What Built/Fixed] + [Realistic Outcome]

---

## 9. QUALITY TARGETS

**Checklist:**
- [ ] 4-6 Tier 1, 4-6 Tier 2 keywords identified
- [ ] 4 priorities ranked with evidence
- [ ] 4 JD-specific rules with examples
- [ ] 6-8 bullet examples (Section 8)
- [ ] All sections (1-8) complete

**Targets:**
- Keyword match: 60-75% of identified keywords appear in resume
- Quantified bullets: 75%+
- Tier 1 usage: 2x each
- Tier 2 usage: 1x each
- Exact phrases: 4+ verbatim
- All 4 priorities demonstrated

**Tone Validation:**
- Uses realistic new grad metrics (Section 5)
- Uses active voice: "Built API...", "Implemented feature..."
- Avoids inflated language ("extensive", "expert")
- Focuses on building/learning, not managing/leading
- Shows technical skills through concrete examples
- Passes reality check: "Could a recent grad do this?"
- Each bullet demonstrates **what you built** (not just 'assisted with')
- Projects section uses **different tech** than internships (shows breadth)
